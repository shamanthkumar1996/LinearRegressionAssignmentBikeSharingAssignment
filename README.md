Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

### _`Conclusion`_
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes
- holiday
- temp
- hum
- Season
- months(January, July, September)
- Year (2019)
- Sat
- weathersit bad

### Area to improve
- Sales during spring needs to be improved
- We see a dep in sale end of year, but this might be due to extreme weather (September month had the highest demand)
- 2019 sales have improved compared to 2018, so it is expected to increase next year
- There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.
